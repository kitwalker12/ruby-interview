# Pseudo code
# Maintain two heaps (mix and max) of about same size

# if more elements in left (max) heap
#   if new element < median (fits in left heap)
#     pop from left
#     insert in right
#   else
#     insert in right
#   median = average from top of left and right
# else if same number of elements
#   if new element < median (fits in left heap)
#     insert in left
#     median = top of left
#   else
#     insert in right
#     median = top of right
# else if more elements in right (min) heap
#   if new element < median (fits in left heap)
#     insert in left
#   else
#     pop from right
#     insert in left
#   median = average from top of left and right
